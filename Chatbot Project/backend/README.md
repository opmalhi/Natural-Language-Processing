# FastAPI Backend for Cravy Chatbot and Cravy-Med Restaurant
This repository contains the backend implementation for the Cravy Chatbot and Cravy-Med Restaurant web application using FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
1. Navigate to the project backend directory:
    ```
    cd <project-folder>
    ```
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install:
     - `fastapi[all]`: FastAPI framework with all optional dependencies.
     - `mysql-connector-python`: MySQL database connector for Python.
3. [Ngork](https://ngrok.com/downloads/windows?tab=download) to expose your local server to the internet:
    - Download Ngrok from [https://ngrok.com/download].
    - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
    - Authenticate Ngrok by running:
        ```
        ngrok authtoken <your-auth-token>
        ```
        Replace `<your-auth-token>` with the token provided on the Ngrok dashboard [https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken].

## Running the Application
1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
    ```
    cd backend
    ```

2. Start the FastAPI server using **Uvicorn**:
    ```
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    - **Uvicorn** is a lightning-fast ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server implementation for Python web applications. It is used to serve FastAPI applications because FastAPI is built on ASGI.

    - The `--reload` flag enables auto-reloading of the server whenever you make changes to your code. This is especially useful during development, as you donâ€™t need to manually restart the server every time you update your files.

## Exposing Your Local Server with Ngrok
Since **Dialogflow** requires a secure HTTPS URL for webhooks and FastAPI runs on HTTP by default, we use **Ngrok** to create a secure tunnel to expose your local server to the internet.
1. Start your FastAPI server using Uvicorn (as shown above).
2. Open a new terminal window and run the following command to start Ngrok: 
    ```
    ngrok http 8000
    ```  
    This will create a secure HTTPS tunnel to your local server running on port 8000.
3. **Ngrok** will provide you with a public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app`). Use this URL as the webhook URL in your **Dialogflow** agent settings.
4. You can inspect incoming requests and responses by visiting the Ngrok web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:4040`.



### Why Use Ngrok for Dialogflow?
- **HTTPS Requirement:** Dialogflow requires webhook URLs to use HTTPS, but FastAPI runs on HTTP by default during development. Ngrok provides an HTTPS URL that forwards requests to your local HTTP server.

- **Testing Webhooks:** Ngrok allows you to test your Dialogflow webhook integration locally without deploying your backend to a live server.

- **Debugging:** Ngrok provides a detailed inspection interface to monitor incoming requests and responses, making it easier to debug issues.

## Accessing the Application
Once the server is running, you can access the following:

- **FastAPI Docs (Swagger UI):**
Open your browser and go to:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

- **ReDoc Documentation:**
Open your browser and go to:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

- **API Endpoints:**
The API will be available at:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

- **Ngrok Public URL (for Dialogflow Webhook):**
Use the Ngrok HTTPS URL provided in the terminal (e.g., `https://<random-subdomain>.ngrok-free.app`).
